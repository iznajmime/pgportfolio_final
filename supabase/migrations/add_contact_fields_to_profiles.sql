  # Add Contact Fields to Profiles

  This migration enhances the `profiles` table by adding optional fields for storing client contact information.

  1. Changes
    - A new `email` column (text) has been added to store client email addresses.
    - A new `phoneNumber` column (text) has been added to store client phone numbers.
    - Both fields are optional to accommodate cases where this information is not provided.
