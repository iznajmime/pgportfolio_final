      # Add Full Name to Profiles

      This migration adds the `full_name` column to the `profiles` table to store the client's full name, resolving an error in the Dashboard component.

      1. Changes
        - A new `full_name` column (of type `text`) has been added to the `profiles` table.
        - This directly addresses the 'column profiles.full_name does not exist' error.
